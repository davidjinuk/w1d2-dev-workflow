Week 1 Day 2
=====

## Preamble / Housekeeping (5m)

* About me
* How I/we lecture. Suggestions for you.
* Assumption about prior knowledge.
* Remote questions

















## Themes: Approach and Debugging

* All about the approach, not the solution
* Primarily Debugging


```javascript
console.log('code example');
```




### Taught via Live Coding

Write a node program that takes in an unlimited number of command line arguments, goes through each and prints out the sum of them. If any argument is not a whole number, skip it. Do support negative numbers though.










### Key Points

* Inner voice and conversation
* Expecting outcome before running (predicting)
* Validate your assumptions in the node console
* MDN/StackOverflow/API docs can help
* Use concrete words to describe your problem if you don't know the words to describe it
* Break your solution into functions as you go
* Write in small (smallest possible executable program) steps
* Refactor => better code with same results
* 15 minute rule, use it all the time
* Practice proper Indentation... always
