Week 1 Day 2
=====

## Preamble / Housekeeping (5m)

* About me
* How I/we lecture. Suggestions for you.
* Assumption about prior knowledge.
* Remote questions

















## Themes: Approach and Debugging

* All about the approach, not the solution
* Primarily Debugging


```javascript
console.log('code example');
```




### Taught via Live Coding

Write a node program that takes in an unlimited number of command line arguments, goes through each and prints out the sum of them. If any argument is not a whole number, skip it. Do support negative numbers though.










### Key Points

* Inner voice and conversation (hypothesis.)
* Expecting outcome before running (predicting)
* Write in small (smallest possible executable program) steps
* Practice proper Indentation... always
* Validate your assumptions in the node console/repl
* `node debug` with `debugger`
  * We used the world REPL (`repl`) but didn't talk about it much. HOMEWORK: research what REPL means and why node uses that word in the `node debug` process.
  * If you're confused about how `repl` works, the best way to initially learn is to read + experiment with it. In the same way that I did up here. If you're still unclear on it, of course by all means, ask a mentor (15m rule! ;)
* Also: don't follow live code.
* MDN/StackOverflow/API docs can help. "Learning to google" is a gradual thing and not as simple as it sounds. It is an art in of itself.
* Use concrete words to describe your problem if you don't know the words to describe it
* Break your solution into functions as you go (input and output!)
* Refactor => better code with same results
* 15 minute rule, use it all the time
* Recommendation: Use markdown starting today, for note taking in class
  * For sublime, you may have to install a markdown syntax highlighter
* Tip: We looked at jquery's README ([formatted](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) vs [raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jquery/jquery/master/README.md))
